                             <p>Hi! I’m Kally and I live in the countryside with my girlfriend and our two dogs, Lily and Poppy. I work in retail but my heart lies on the computer, whether it’s learning to be a kick-ass web developer or streaming in my spare time. In my stream, I like to play Apex Legends despite not being the best; I like to smash lego things and watch the coins go weeeee!; and my community likes to make me play horror games so I squeal like a badger. 
                                We also raise money for a charity called Become, under the name of Become Players. Become are fighting for a better care system in the UK – one where every child in care and young care leaver receives the love, support and stability they deserve. Since 2020, when Covid made life harder for care leavers, my community has helped me to raise £2,635.
